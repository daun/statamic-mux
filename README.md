# Statamic Mux

Enable seamless video encoding and streaming with this [Mux](https://www.mux.com/) integration for Statamic sites.

## Philosophy

The main goal of this addon: **make working with videos as easy as working with images**. All the magic
happens behind the scenes: videos are mirrored to your Mux account and can start streaming within seconds
using the official `<mux-video>` web component as a drop-in replacement for the native video element.

## Responsive Video

Just like image pipelines efficiently deliver optimized images for faster load times on a variety of devices
and connections, video encoding services like Mux play a crucial role for optimizing video content.
Video encoding demands more resources and expertise than image processing, so a dedicated service
like Mux becomes essential for performant websites.

## Why Mux?

While there is a host of services for video encoding to choose from, Mux offers all the key
components: encoding, storage, and delivery. It stands out with its API-first approach prioritizing
developer productivity, as well as its official web components for creating rich, customized video players.
