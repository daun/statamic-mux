::: details Note about command names

Examples on this page use Statamic's [Please](https://statamic.dev/cli#artisan-vs-please) console,
which allows dropping the `statamic` namespace from command names. When using Laravel's
[Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/artisan) console, make sure to include the full namespace: `php artisan statamic:mux:upload`.
